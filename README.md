# Mimicking Our Love Language

Welcome to **Mimicking Our Love Language**! ❤️ This project is a heartfelt exploration of natural language processing (NLP) and its ability to understand and mimic the way we express love and emotions through words. Whether you're a language enthusiast, a developer, or just someone curious about how machines can interpret human emotions, this project is for you!

## 🌟 Features
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identify and extract meaningful entities from text.
- **Text Parsing:** Analyze and break down sentences to understand their structure and meaning.
- **Utility Functions:** A collection of helpful tools to support NLP tasks.
